                <h1>Designing for Play</h1>


                <p>For half a decade as an industrial designer, I designed commercial goods and experiences for young
                    audiences. My work ranged across all kinds of media including wooden toys, animations, coloring
                    activities, and craft supplies. My goal was consistent: to reward curiosity with wonder and
                    delightful discoveries.</p>
                <p>
                    I’d love to share with you highlights about what I learned about designing for people as a toy
                    designer by celebrating some of my favorite designs.
                </p>
                <h2>Simple, Mindful, and Valuable</h2>
                <p>
                    The best designs need no instruction or a surplus of cues that distract at worst. For example, the
                    <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Smarts-Crafts-Alien-Explorer-Painting-Craft-Kit-22-Pieces-Unisex-Kids-Teens/316434196"
                        target="_blank">Alien Explorer for Smarts & Crafts</a> presented itself as a two piece wooden
                    set with paints and paint brushes.
                </p>
                <div class="row gtr-uniform"  style="margin: -2em 0 3em 0;">

                <p>
                    Without written instruction or a synopsis about who the explorer is, I invited the crafter to invent
                    their own character and ways to play with the provided supplies. Whether the explorer had one or
                    three eyes, a rocket with funky stripes or polka dots, <span class="highlight">the crafter was on
                        their own unique journey in creating value and a relationship with their toy. </span>

                <p>
                    The Alien Explorer became a high demand item upon release, landing in Smarts & Crafts’s top 10 best
                    sellers in the first two months with over 3,000 SKUs sold. Its success allowed me to design more
                    toys of its kind for the Paint and Play series.

                <h2>Capitalizing on Color, Shape, and Material</h2>
                <p>
                    I believe that the most universal way to communicate is through our senses and emotions. In physical
                    and digital products, we yearn to explore with what our body affords us through sight, smell, sound,
                    taste, and touch. Therefore, effective choice in materials, shapes, and color can greatly add value
                    to a product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When it came to art making supplies, I loved any opportunity to reject the “typical.” Sets of
                    crayons I designed for Craft Class like <b>Galactic Crayons</b> not only allowed makers to celebrate
                    iconic shapes as crayons but also prompted them to see what curves, edges, and patterns could make
                    as marks
                </p>
                <div class="box alt" style="margin: -2em 0 3em 0;">
                    <div class="row gtr-uniform">

                <p>In another part of the crayon spectrum, the <a
                        href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Smarts-Crafts-Specialty-Robot-Shaped-Crayon/612070646"
                        target="_blank">Robot Smush Crayon</a> featured consistent right angles and hard edges, but
                    boasts Smarts & Crafts’s signature mosaic of colors smushed together.</p>

                <div id="flexContainer"  style="margin: -2em 0 3em 0;">

                </div>

                <p>As for material, I explored new ways to apply paint onto a page by changing how one can hold a brush
                    extend either fine or gross motor movements with <b>Hand Brushes</b> and <b>Fantastic Finger
                        Brushes</b> for Craft Class, and swapping different materials as bristles.</p>

                <h2>Personalizing How I Understand Users</h2>

                <p>The key to understanding young audiences in an interview is the same as it is for any other age
                    group: tailoring your questions so that the volunteer is engaged, comfortable, and heard without
                    bias.</p>

                <p>I first gained experience play testing with children with my ride-on toy <b>Manny</b>. In a room full
                    of prototypes, volunteers were free to roam, climb, push, and draw on anything. <span
                        class="highlight">
                        As they played, I
                        asked open ended questions to gain insights on how to make Manny more accessible and exciting.
                    </span>
                    Inviting them to imagine what kind of creature Manny was and observing which features they were
                    drawn to educated the final form and finish. Manny would then be featured on Rhode Island School of
                    Design’s portfolios.</p>
                <span class="image fit"><img src="images/DESIGNING_PLAY/MANNY/MANNY.PNG"

                <h2>Iterations and Collaboration</h2>

                <p>Alongside my quest to design for fun were designers of diverse specialties, shop technicians,
                    mentors, and business experts that I consulted and collaborated with in order to deliver delightful
                    creations to thousands of homes nationwide. I am exercised in <span class="highlight">sharing
                        libraries of information including specs, 3D visualizations, prototypes, and presentations to
                        stakeholders and manufacturers to perfect each millimeter and pixel of a vision.</span> I
                    learned to surrender ego and embrace iterations and edits as a necessary metamorphosis for the most
                    wonderful product.</p>

                <h2>Gratitudes and Achievements</h2>

                <p>1. I take pride in being opportunistic and challenging all the components of a physical good – from
                    packaging to product – to be <span class="highlight">sourced from renewable or easily recyclable
                        sources.</span> Small choices like swapping twist ties for fiber cordage to anchor a
                    product in place or swapping plastic blister pack for cardboard cutouts make large impact when
                    featured in thousands of
                    products.</p>
