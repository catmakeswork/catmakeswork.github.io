				<p>As children, we escape the bounds of reality on our imaginary steeds: whether a rusty race car, a
					runt unicorn, or a giant snail. In becoming the dream ride-on toy for 3 to 6 year old children,
					Manny acts as a character who happens to have a lot to say. Manny is:</p>

				<h4>Responsive in a way that educates for sensory play</h4>
				As observed from the toy market for children under 10 years of age, it is popular to include materials
				that attribute to a child's ability to recognize the five senses. Manny, aside from having a soft felt
				seat, features squeakers in the ears and saddle. A big surprise to any kid who sits and drives Manny!

								<h4>Comfortable in both structural confidence and squish of the seat</h4>
								While the option of playing with an adult is always available, Manny aims to empower
								children to play on their own. Large wheels make it difficult for the child to offset
								the toy and fall off. Furthermore, the cushioned seat makes sitting/lying/flopping onto
								the toy more delightful.

								<h4>Whimsical and inspires open-ended role playing and character development</h4>
								Inspired by the unique tapir, Manny is acceptably mistaken for a rabbit, giraffe, pig,
								dog, and much more. It's up to the child to create the lore and personality that makes
								up this noisy critter.

				<h2>Process</h2>

				Quick 3D sketches investigated options in ergonomics, functionality, accessibility to the features, and
				balance. Over the course of three days, children (ages three to six years) visited the studio for user
				testing. The observations were organized in the categories:
				<ul>
					<li>"Where can I sit?"</li>
					<li>"Let me play with..."</li>
					<li>"Who are you?"</li>
				</ul>
				</p>

						<td><img src="images/PRODUCT/MANNY/MANNY_Build_8.jpg" width="100%"></td>
					</tr>
				</table>

				<p>With many thanks to our participants, the drawing board was revisited to accommodate comfort,
					sensational play, and character! Explorations of lamination and interchangeable parts allowed for
					considerations of mass production and a family of tapoots.</p>
