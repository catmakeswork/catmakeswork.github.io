				<h1>Say App Redesign</h1>
				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p><a href="https://www.getsay.app/" target="_blank">Say</a> is a mobile application by Impulsa Co. that
					tackles language learning with a primary focus in speaking. Using AI, Say helps users build and
					practice phrases in another language to "say what they want to say" without having to learn theory.

				</p>
				<p>Over the course of two weeks in July 2023, I was invited to identify their target user and
					restructure the flow of the app. My roles were mapping the user journey, conducting user research,
					and designing a new Home screen in preparation for their launch onto the App Store.</p>
				<h2>Preliminary Investigations</h2>
				<p>
					<span class="image fit"><img src="images/SAY/say_to_improve.webp" alt="" /></span>

					To kick start the design sprint, I investigated what opportunities existed within the initial
					prototypes
					and shared my impressions and feedback to the design team. I also took note of actions and UI elements
					to
					observe in user interviews.
				</p>


				<span class="image left"><img src="images/SAY/say-stickies.webp" alt="" /></span>
				<p>
					Additionally, I took some time with the founder to analyze Say’s competitors in the lenses of their
					target audiences, branding, voice, typical user journeys, and their offerings in learning tools with
					sticky notes.
				</p>
				<!-- 
				[graphic representation of three questions] -->
				<p>
					Through these conversations , I identified three areas of growth that aligned with Say’s goals:
					<span class="highlight">how can the app inspire a daily rhythm without being prescriptive, how can
						we highlight Say’s ethos and identity, and how can we celebrate checkpoints in the user’s
						journey?</span> These would be my guiding questions as I proceeded with the sprint.
				</p>

				<h2>Meeting the Target User</h2>
				<p>
					We invited a volunteer to perform user testing and speak their impressions, actions, and
					frustrations. The volunteer was selected from a pool of people who are<span class="highlight">enthusiastic to learn languages for travel.</span> I observed the volunteer's
					journey without providing instruction. We closed up the
					interview by asking the volunteer what elements of language learning were fulfilling, their biases
					towards AI, and what they would change.
				</p>
				<h2>Analyzing the Data</h2>
				<!--Image of persona-->

					<div id="flexContainer">
						<div id="flexItemTrio">
							<span class="image fit" style="padding:1em;">
								<img src="images/SAY/say-persona.webp" alt="Say Persona by Cat Hong"></span>
							<p>
							<h3>Lindsay</h3>
							<i>the Immersive Vacationeer</i></p>
						</div>
						<div id="flexItemTrio">
							<p><b>Motivators:</b> To brush up on Spanish and go deeper with grammatical nuances and
								pronunciation. Also driven by challenges.</p>
							<p><b>Desires:</b> Wants a personalized experience where learning is based on her own
								pace
								and built upon a goal in mind (e.g. traveling somewhere, being able to discuss
								everyday
								concepts with her parents). Loves flashcards.</p>
						</div>

						<div id="flexItemTrio">
							<p><b>Pain Points:</b> Dislikes linear systems. Feels limited in other language learning
								apps that don't explore advanced topics like politics.</p>
							<p><b>Biases:</b> Anticipates correction on pronunciation or conjugation of words.
								Believes
								that vocabulary is necessary to advance in a language. Skeptical of the depth of AI
								conversations.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<!---->

				<p>
					Based on the walkthrough with our participant, I created a persona to empathize and understand the
					Say user's motivators, desires, pain points, and biases. As I embarked new improvements to the Home
					page, I cross referenced these observations in order to meet the expectations and needs for the Say
					power user.
				</p>
			


				<h2>Redesign</h2>

				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/SAY/say-sketches.webp" alt="" /></span>
				<p>Prior to sketching, I researched layouts of existing personal tracking applications. In addition to
					competing language learning apps, I considered apps that measure personal growth such
					as
					activity trackers, games, horoscope apps, and banking. <span class="highlight">To offer a personalized experience, it is cruicial to design a space where users can reflect on their progress and accomplishments.</span> After a round of reviews with the design team, I presented two options for the Home screen:
				</p>
				<!--Design 1-->
				<div id="flexContainer">
					<div id="flexItem40">
						<span class="image fit"><img src="images/SAY/say-redesign-2.webp" alt="" /></span>
						
						
					
					
					</div>
					<div id="flexItem60">

						<h3>Option 1</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Addresses immediate graphic design issues.</li>
							<li>Prioritizes personalized user data such as day streaks, how many words and phrases
								they've
								learned, and their own name.</li>
							<li> Buttons are more descriptive and styled like physical buttons to increase learnability.
							</li>
							<li><b>Top Bar Navigation:</b> Simplified to two actions that users would benefit from on
								all
								pages
								of the app – Language selection and Settings.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				</div>
				<!--Design 2-->

				<div id="flexContainer">
					<div id="flexItem40">
						
						<iframe width="463" height="930" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2FkCJS7OQ2Pf2iumMt412IHU%2FSay-Home%3Fpage-id%3D0%253A1%26type%3Ddesign%26node-id%3D115-80%26viewport%3D-58%252C840%252C1.04%26t%3DhqBXqi8AeLrlK1h5-1%26scaling%3Dscale-down%26mode%3Ddesign" allowfullscreen style="border-radius: 1.5em;"></iframe>
						
					
					</div>
					<div id="flexItem60">
						<h3>Option 2 </h3>
						<span class="highlight">Interactive!</span><p> Iterated from Option 1, Option 2 advances in the usability and playfulness of the app.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Personalization:</b> In addition to user data and greetings, the Buttons reference
								previous app activity.</li>
							<li><b>Voice:</b> With the Buddy acting as a peer, I emphasized the voice of the app as
								relaxed
								and
								casual.</li>
							<li><b>Non-linear Guidance:</b> Introduction of daily challenges for consideration and educate new users what is possible.</li>
							<li><b>Bottom Navigation Bar:</b> Creating quick access to the Sentence Builder – a unique
								activity
								in addition to the Buddy and Phrasebook.</li>
								<li><b>Animated interactions:</b> Smoothing out and adding motion to elevate the experience</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				</div>

				<h2>Takeaways</h2>

				Working with the Say team for their design sprint was a valuable experience. It was an invigorating
				challenge to design the flow and navigation of a language learning app that boasts multiple activities.
				It opened my eyes to different attitudes about AI and its potential to educate users in different
				settings.
