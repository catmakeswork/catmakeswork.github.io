				<h1>Dream Skate Maker</h1>
				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p>Dream Skate Maker is an ongoing personal project of mine that I started in 2022. Currently I singlehandedly manage the research, visual and experience design, and development. This page serves to document what I have accomplished and learned so far.
				</p>
				<h2>The Opportunity</h2>

				<h2>Discovering a Niche</h2>

							<h3>Lindsay</h3>
							<i>the Immersive Vacationeer</i></p>
						</div>
						<div id="flexItemTrio">
							<p><b>Motivators:</b> To brush up on Spanish and go deeper with grammatical nuances and
								pronunciation. Also driven by challenges</p>
							<p><b>Desires:</b> Wants a personalized experience where learning is based to her own
								tempo
								and built upon a goal in mind (e.g. traveling somewhere, being able to discuss
								everyday
								concepts with her parents). Loves flashcards.</p>
						</div>

						<div id="flexItemTrio">
							<p><b>Pain Points:</b> Dislikes linear systems. Feels limited in other language learning
								apps that don't explore advanced topics like politics.</p>
							<p><b>Biases:</b> Anticipates correction on pronunciation or conjugation of words.
								Believes
								that vocabulary is necessary to advance in a language. Skeptical of the depth of AI
								conversations.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<!---->

				<p>
					Based on the walkthrough with our participant, I created a persona to empathize and understand the
					Say user's motivators, desires, pain points, and biases. As I embarked new improvements to the Home
					page, I cross referenced these observations in order to meet the expectations and needs for the Say
					power user.

				<!-- (mental model; how it should work) (eg: If one waits for the walking man they can walk. One can choose
				to press the button
				requesting for the walking man but it generally does nothing other than provide emotional
				comfort. When the red hand signal is on it is a suggestion to standby. If there are no cars
				visible, cross at any time.) -->



				<h2>Moving Forward...</h2>

				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/SAY/say-sketches.webp" alt="" /></span>
				<p>Prior to sketching, I researched the architecture of relevant applications and system. In addition to
					competing language learning apps, I also considered applications that measured personal growth such
					as
					activity trackers, games, horoscope apps, and banking. I wanted to fulfill the target user’s desire
					to
					have a space where they can reflect on their progress and accomplishments.

						<h3>Option 2</h3>
						<p>Iterated from Option 1, Option 2 advances in the usability and playfulness of the app.

						<ul>
							<li><b>Personalization:</b> In addition to user data and greetings, the Buttons reference
								how
								the
								user used the app previously.</li>
							<li><b>Voice:</b> With the Buddy acting as a peer, I emphasized the voice of the app as
								relaxed
								and
								casual.</li>
							<li><b>Non-linear Guidance:</b> Introduction of daily challenges to inspire the user's goals
								for
								the
								day and educate new users what is possible.</li>
							<li><b>Bottom Navigation Bar:</b> Creating quick access to the Sentence Builder – a unique
								activity
								in addition to the Buddy and Phrasebook.</li>
						</ul>

				<h2>Takeaways</h2>

				Working with the Say team for their design sprint was a valuable experience. It was an invigorating
				challenge to design the flow and navigation of a language learning app that boasts multiple activities.
				It opened my eyes to different attitudes about AI and its potential to educate users in different
				settings.
