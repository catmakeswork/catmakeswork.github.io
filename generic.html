							<h1>Say App Redesign</h1>
							<h2>Overview</h2>
							<p><a href="https://www.getsay.app/" target="_blank">Say</a> is a mobile application by Impulsa Co. that tackles language learning with a primary focus in speaking. Using AI, Say helps users build and practice phrases in another language to "say what they want to say" without having to learn theory.

							</p>
							<p>Over the course of two weeks in July 2023, I was invited to identify their target user and restructure the flow of the app.  My roles were mapping the user journey, conducting user research, and designing a new Home screen in preparation for their launch onto the App Store.</p>
							<h2>Preliminary Investigations</h2>
							<p>[image of meeting/image of areas of improvement]

								To kick start the design sprint, I investigated what opportunities existed within the initial prototypes and shared my impressions and feedback to the design team. I also took note of signals and actions to observe in user interviews.</p>

								<p>Additionally, I took some time with the founder to analyze Say’s competitors in the lenses of their target audiences, branding, voice, typical user journeys, and their offerings in learning tools with sticky notes.</p>
								
								[graphic representation of three questions]
								<p>
								Through these conversations , I identified three areas of growth that aligned with Say’s goals: <span class="highlight">how can the app inspire a daily rhythm without being prescriptive, how can we highlight Say’s ethos and identity, and how can we celebrate checkpoints in the user’s journey?</span> These would be my guiding questions as I proceeded with the sprint.</p>

								<h2>Meeting the Target User</h2>
								<p>
								We invited a volunteer to perform user testing and speak their impressions, actions, and frustrations. The volunteer was selected from a pool of people who identified as language learning enthusiasts and specifically so because they wanted learn for travel. We directed the user only at certain stalls and near the end when the volunteer had completely missed features we wanted to test. Otherwise, the volunteer was free to roam and I observed the flow of their journey. We closed up the interview by asking the volunteer what elements of language learning were fulfilling, their biases towards AI, and what they would change.
							</p>
								<h2>Analyzing the Data</h2>

								<p>
								Based on the walkthrough with our participant, I created a persona to empathize and understand the Say user's motivators, desires, pain points, and biases. As I embarked new improvements to the Home page, I cross referenced these observations in order to meet the expectations and needs for the Say power user.
							</p>
								(mental model; how it should work) (eg: If one waits for the walking man they can walk. One can choose to press the button
								requesting for the walking man but it generally does nothing other than provide emotional
								comfort. When the red hand signal is on it is a suggestion to standby. If there are no cars
								visible, cross at any time.)

								
								
								<h2>Redesign</h2>

								<h3>Sketches</h3>
								Prior to sketching, I researched the architecture of relevant applications and system. In addition to competing language learning apps, I also considered applications that measured personal growth such as activity trackers, games, horoscope apps, and banking. I wanted to fulfill the target user’s desire to have a space where they can reflect on their progress and accomplishments.
							
								
								<h2>Takeaways</h2>
								
								Working with the Say team for their design sprint was a valuable experience. It was an invigorating challenge to design the flow and navigation of a language learning app that boasts multiple activities. It opened my eyes to different attitudes about AI and its potential to educate users in different settings.
