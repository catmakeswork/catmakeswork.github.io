				<p><a href="https://www.getsay.app/">Say</a> is a mobile application by Impulsa Co. that approaches
					language learning with a fresh approach that prioritizes speaking. Using AI, Say helps users build
					and practice phrases in another language to "say what they want to say" without having to learn
					theory.</p>



				<b>Design Challenge</b>
				<p>The Say app was trying to understand their target users and the hierarchy of their learning tools.
					Prior to their launch in July 2023, I was asked to analyze the user experience of the app and
					provide improvements to the flow. </p>

				<p>My responsibilites for this project include: consulting, conducting user research, and re-designing
					the Home screen.</p>



				<h2>Research</h2>
				<div class="box alt">
					<div class="row gtr-uniform">


					
						<div class="col-12">
							<h4>Understanding the User</h4>
							<p>We invited a volunteer to perform user testing and speak their impressions. Our objective
								was to answer three main questions:
							<ul>
								<li>What do people do unprompted?</li>
								<li>Is there a sense of flow?</li>
								<li>What changes need to be made on the Home Page?</li>
							</ul>
							</p>
							<p>Based on this walkthrough I created a persona to visualize a Say user's motivators,
								desires, pain points, and biases.</p><br>

												<i>the Immersive Vacationeer</i></p>

							<p><b>Motivators:</b> To brush up on Spanish and go deeper with grammatical nuances and
								pronunciation. Also driven by challenges</p>
							<p><b>Desires:</b> Wants a personalized experience where learning is based to her own tempo
								and built upon a goal in mind (e.g. traveling somewhere, being able to discuss everyday
								concepts with her parents). Loves flashcards.</p>
							<p><b>Pain Points:</b> Dislikes linear systems. Feels limited in other language learning
								apps that don't explore advanced topics like politics.</p>
							<p><b>Biases:</b> Anticipates correction on pronunciation or conjugation of words. Believes
								that vocabulary is necessary to advance in a language. Skeptical of the depth of AI
								conversations.</p>

							<h4>Analyzing Original Design</h4>
							<p><span class="image fit"><a href="images/EXPERIENCES/SAY/say_to_improve.png"><img

											alt="Say Home Redesign critique"></a></span></p>
							<h2>Sketches</h2>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EXPERIENCES/SAY/say_sketches.jpg"
									alt="Say Home Redesign sketches"></span>
							<p>As a culmination from discussions about Say's identity and valuable user testing, I began
								redesigning the Home screen with sketches. I considered layouts not only from other
								language learning apps, but other apps that succeeded in measuring personal growth such
								as activity trackers, games, horoscope apps, and banking. </p>
							<p></p>

				<h2>The Visual Redesign</h2>
				<p>I created mockups of two options of Say's Home page. </p>
				<section id="one" class="wrapper spotlights">
					<section class>
						<span class="image fit" style="height:70vh;">
							<img src="images/EXPERIENCES/SAY/hpv5.png">
						</span>
						<div class="content">
							<div class="inner">
								<h4>Option 1</h4>
								<ul>
									<li>Addresses immediate graphic design issues</li>
									<li>Prioritizes personalized user data such as day streaks, how many words and phrases they've learned, and their own name</li>
									<li> Buttons are more descriptive and styled like physical buttons to increase learnability</li>
								<li><b>Top Bar Navigation:</b> Simplified to two actions that users would benefit from on all pages of the app – Language selection and Settings</li></ul>
							</div>
					</section>

					<section class>
						<span class="image fit" style="height:70vh;">
							<img src="images/EXPERIENCES/SAY/hpv4.png">
						</span>
						<div class="content">
							<div class="inner">
								<h4>Option 2</h4>
								<p>Iterated from Option 1, Option 2 advances in the usability and playfulness of the app. 
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li><b>Personalization:</b> In addition to user data and greetings, the Buttons reference how the user used the app previously</li>
										<li><b>Voice:</b> With the Buddy acting as a peer, I emphasized the voice of the app as relaxed and casual</li>
										<li><b>Non-linear Guidance:</b> Introduction of daily challenges to inspire the user's goals for the day and educate new users what is possible</li>
										<li><b>Bottom Navigation Bar:</b> Creating quick access to the Sentence Builder – a unique activity in addition to the Buddy and Phrasebook</li>
									</ul>

				<h2>Takeaways</h2>
				<p>Working with the Say team for their design sprint was a valuable experience. It was an invigorating challenge to design the flow and navigation of a language learning app that boasts multiple activities. It opened my eyes to different attitudes about AI and its potential to educate users in different settings.</p>
