                <h1>Scout</h1>
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Scout is a pocket field guide for the explorer enjoying National Parks. In this project I exercised user testing, brand design, and prototyping.</p>

                <h2>Spotting Opportunity</h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired to design Scout from my typical experience in group hikes: <span class="highlight">I spot an interesting plant or animal but would fail to communicate what it was.</span> Upon sharing the struggles of my travels, I realized I wasn’t the only one <span class="highlight">yearning to learn more on the go:</span> my friends would empathize and reminisce on anonymous critters in their past walks. Furthermore, with the existence of apps like <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/" target="_blank">iNaturalist</a>, it was apparent that this was a universal phenomenon. 
                </p>

                <h2>Understanding</h2>
                <div class="box alt">
                    <div class="row gtr-uniform">
                        <div class="col-4">
                            <span class="image fit">
                                <img src="images/SCOUT/scout_PERSONA1.webp">
                            </span>
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-4">
                            <span class="image fit">

                        </div>
                        <div class="col-4">
                            <span class="image fit">
                                <img src="images/SCOUT/scout_PERSONA3.webp">
                            </span>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    As a first step, I scoped for <span class="highlight">more information regarding people’s relationship with hiking and nature.</span> I organized group interviews of self-proclaimed hikers and charted my observations in three personas. 
                </p>
                
                <!-- [Mind Map] -->
                <p>Based on these personas, I drafted an ideal mental map of how a target user would integrate an app like Scout in their typical nature walks.</p>
                

                <h2>Development</h2>
                <span class="image fit">
                    <img src="images/SCOUT/scout_userflow.png"></span>
               <p>I started my process with a site map to visualize the navigation and user flow. <span class="highlight">I was inspired by the interactive and approachable qualities of dichotomous keys</span> and adopted their utility as the means for identifying a specimen. I also prioritized access to resource materials <b>[Library]</b> and the user’s archive<b>[Album]</b> via the bottom navigation.</p>
                            
               <span class="image fit">
                <img src="images/SCOUT/scout_wireframes.png"></span>
                           <p>Using Figma, I determined the architecture and composition of Scout’s screens with a low fidelity wireframe. </p>     
                           
                        <p>Upon play testing this lo-fi model with a group of volunteers, I learned how to improve the experience and discovered <span class="highlight">a new desire of my target user: a page to review their personal achievements.</span></p>
            


                <h2>Branding</h2>

                <div class="box alt">
                    <div class="row gtr-uniform">

                        <div class="col-6">
                            <span class="image fit">

                        </div>
                        <div class="col-6">
                            <span class="image fit">

                    </div>
                </div>


                <p>I derived a color story pulled from swatches seen in nature resources such as National Geographic, Discovery, and other park guides. I emulated typefaces and imagery that felt native to existing
                    hiking products and branding. <span class="highlight">
                        Binoculars were selected to represent Scout because of its association to
                        adventure and adjusting a bionculars’ focus emulates the wayfinding process.
                    </span></p>

                <h2>Hi-Fi Model</h2>
                <p>Informed by branding iterations and revisions, I developed a high fidelity prototype using Figma and Adobe Illustrator for
                    icons and graphics. </p>

                        The app loads with an introduction of Scout’s logo and purpose. Sign up is kept
                        simple and short.

                        After opening the app, Scout defaults to the identification tab Scout. When a user snaps a photo
                        of their specimen, they will answer a series of question cards to determine what the
                        specimen is.

                        In order to identify against relevant specimens based on location, the user will need to select the appropriate database in the Library tab.

                        Living in the moment is the goal, but Scout wants users to be able to look back on the
                        specimens they’ve seen in their Album. Organizational filters allow for quick access for
                        impromptu storytelling.

                        Statistics in the My Ranger tab gratify and inspire the user to countinue scouting and
                        learning about more specimens.

                <h2>Takeaways</h2>
                <p>I'd love to launch a version of Scout at a small scale with local parks with a team of
                    engineers. I found it rewarding and insightful to interview users that range from casual, easy-going
                    hikers to those who make it their weekly activity and enjoy the outdoor splendor. In order to
                    measure the success of Scout, I want to publish it to App stores and gather more feedback from real users.</p>
