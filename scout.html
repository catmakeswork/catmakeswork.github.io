							<p>Scout is a mobile application designed to accompany you in national parks and provide you the tools to identify specimens as you explore! </p> 

								<p>As a nature enthusiast who has lived near woods and parks her entire life, I found the inspiration for this project when I visited <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yell/index.htm" target="_blank">Yellowstone National Park</a> with my family. I loved spotting all the animals and flowers I saw, but felt hopeless when someone would ask, <i>“Okay so, what is that?”</i> </p>

<b>Design problem </b>
<p>How can I make deeper experiences while exploring the wilderness? I have a desire to learn more about the wildlife I see, but no means to surf the internet when I am in an area without service.</p>

<b>Design Criteria</b>
<ul> <li>Enrich hiking experience without sacrificing quality “screen-free” time</li>
<li>Simple, clean and straightforward while affording delightful learning moments</li>
<li>Honoring the services of National Park resources</li>
<li>Potential for memory banking</li></ul>

<p>My responsibilites for this project include: design and branding guidelines, user resarch, lo-fi and hi-fi prototyping, and conceptualizing.</p>

<p>To assess interest in Scout and understand current pain points, I interviewed hikers of various levels. The personas above illustrate the three general categories of users I could see benefiting from Scout: the Escapist, the Survivor, and the Nature Lover.  </p>

<h2>Lo-Fi Models</h2>
<div class="box alt">
	<div class="row gtr-uniform">
		
		

		<div class="col-12">

		</div>

		<div class="col-12">
			<span class="image fit">
				<img src="images/EXPERIENCES/SCOUT/scout_wireframes.png"></span>
		</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>A sitemap and wireframes represent the user flow for Scout. I wanted the experience to be reminiscent of dichotomous field guides and the Pokédex from the Pokémon franchise. A dichotomous key makes identifying a specimen more approachable and interactive as it is broken down into a series of simple questions. The Pokédex indexing aspect would satisfy users who seek to collect memories of the specimens they’ve encountered and making the app engaging. </p>


<h2>Branding</h2>

<p>I derived a color story pulled from swatches seen in nature resources such as National Geographic, Discovery, and other park guides. I was drawn to typefaces and imagery that felt native to existing hiking products and branding. I chose a pair of binoculars as a mascot because it is represents exploration and adjusting a bionculars’ focus emulates the wayfinding process.</p>

<h2>Hi-Fi Model</h2>
<p>To develop a high fidelity prototype, I utilized Figma for the flow and Adobe Illustrator for iconography and graphics. </p>

<h2>Takeaways</h2>
<p>Moving forward, I plan to launch a version of Scout at a small scale with local parks with a team of engineers. I found it rewarding and insightful to interview users that range from casual, easy-going hikers to those who make it their weekly activity and enjoy the outdoor splendor. In order to measure the success in my design criteria, I want to observe how streamlined the app serves in real time.</p>
